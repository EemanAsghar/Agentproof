## Overview

AI agents change behavior silently. A prompt edit, a model upgrade, a tool or MCP change, or a knowledge-base refresh can alter how an agent responds while it continues to reply normally — so the regression reaches production unnoticed. Conventional tests assert on exact output and cannot validate probabilistic, language-based behavior.

AgentProof brings CI/CD discipline to AI agents. It expresses expected behavior as **behavioral contracts**, validates an agent against them on every change, compares the results to the last known-good baseline, and produces a deployment decision — gating releases before they reach users.

AgentProof is built and run **on the UiPath Platform**: the validation engine is a UiPath coded agent, and the agents it validates are executed as real UiPath Orchestrator jobs.

<img src="docs/problem-value.png" alt="Problem to value — the difference AgentProof makes" width="92%"/>
</div>

> **In one line —** AgentProof is continuous integration for agent *behavior*: it catches the regressions that still "reply correctly" but no longer act correctly.

## How it works

| Step | What happens |
|:----:|:-------------|
| **1 · Connect** | Authenticate with a UiPath tenant. AgentProof discovers the agents published in your Orchestrator. |
| **2 · Define** | Describe expected behavior in plain language; an LLM generates the behavioral contracts. No manual test authoring. |
| **3 · Validate** | Each scenario runs against the agent — natively, as a real UiPath Orchestrator job — and an LLM-as-judge scores every contract with a pass/fail, confidence, and reasoning. |
| **4 · Detect drift** | Results are compared against the last passing baseline. A severity-weighted drift score yields `PASSED`, `DEGRADED`, or `FAILED`. |
| **5 · Gate** | On `FAILED`, the deployment is blocked. Regressions are listed with reasoning, an alert is raised, a PDF report is generated, and the run is recorded on a per-tenant dashboard. |

## Why AgentProof is different

Existing tools either assert on exact strings (and miss behavioral drift) or evaluate prompts in isolation (off-platform, with no deployment gate). **AgentProof validates behavior, on the platform, and turns the result into a release decision.**

<div align="center">

| Capability | Unit / integration tests | Prompt-eval tools | **AgentProof** |
|:-----------|:----------------------:|:-----------------:|:--------------:|
| Validates language-based behavior | ✗ | ✓ | **✓** |
| Regression detection vs. a baseline | ✗ | partial | **✓** |
| Executes on UiPath Orchestrator | ✗ | ✗ | **✓** |
| Deployment gate + audit trail | ✗ | ✗ | **✓** |

</div>

## Native execution on UiPath

Most agent-testing tools call an HTTP endpoint. **AgentProof runs the agent on the platform:** it starts a real Orchestrator job (`StartJobs`), polls the job to completion, reads the agent's output from `OutputArguments`, and validates that output against the contracts.

UiPath Automation Cloud is the **execution layer**; the web application is only the **control plane**.

> The diagram below shows how AgentProof orchestrates validation **natively through UiPath Automation Cloud**, with the web app acting purely as a control plane.

<div align="center">
<img src="docs/system-architecture.png" alt="AgentProof system architecture" width="92%"/>
</div>

> **Verified live —** target agents (ShopEasy, IT Helpdesk, …) execute as Orchestrator jobs and are judged on their actual output. **AgentProof's own validation engine also runs as an Orchestrator job** — a real run completed `Successful` with `status=FAILED`, `drift=58.8%`, and results written to Postgres, entirely on UiPath. Both the orchestrator and the agents under test run on the platform.

## UiPath platform components

| Component | Usage |
|:----------|:------|
| **UiPath for Coding Agents** *(Claude Code)* | The entire solution — coded agent, engine, control plane, and tenant integration — was built using Claude Code. |
| **UiPath Coded Agents** *(Python SDK)* | The validation engine (`main.py`) is a coded agent implemented as a LangGraph pipeline, packaged with `uipath pack` and published to Orchestrator. |
| **UiPath Orchestrator** | Discovers published agents, starts them as jobs (`StartJobs`), polls execution, and retrieves results from `OutputArguments`. |
| **UiPath Assets** | Published agents read their runtime secret from an Orchestrator Asset, keeping credentials out of the package. |
| **UiPath Automation Cloud** | Agents execute on Automation Cloud; the tenant is the unit of identity and data isolation. |
| **External frameworks** | LangGraph for pipeline orchestration; OpenAI `gpt-4o-mini` (via OpenRouter) as the LLM judge. UiPath remains the orchestration and governance layer. |

## Architecture

> The flow below demonstrates the **complete validation lifecycle** — from connecting a tenant, to running the agent as an Orchestrator job, to the final deployment decision.

### The execution graph

> This is the internal **LangGraph execution graph** that powers every validation run — six nodes, each with an explicit input and output, so a run is fully traceable end to end.

## Behavioral contracts

A behavioral contract is a typed rule the agent's response must satisfy. Because contracts are evaluated by an LLM judge, they validate probabilistic, language-based behavior that exact-match assertions cannot.

| Contract type | Validates |
|:--------------|:----------|
| `contains_intent` | The response expresses a required intent or commitment |
| `does_not_contain` | The response avoids prohibited content or actions |
| `sentiment` | The response holds a required tone |
| `response_length` | The response stays within a word limit |
| `format_compliance` | The response follows a required structure |
| `safety` | The response contains no harmful or disallowed content |

Each test case carries a severity that weights the drift score — **`critical` ×3, `high` ×2, `medium` ×1, `low` ×0.5**. Status thresholds: `PASSED` below 5%, `DEGRADED` 5–15%, `FAILED` above 15%.

## Getting started

**Prerequisites** — Python 3.12+, [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv), an `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, a PostgreSQL `DATABASE_URL`, and a UiPath Automation Cloud tenant.

```bash
# 1. Install
uv venv && source .venv/bin/activate && uv pip install -e .

# 2. Configure
cp .env.example .env        # set OPENROUTER_API_KEY and DATABASE_URL

# 3. Run the validator as a coded agent (locally or on UiPath)
uv run uipath run agent '{"suite_id":"aria_customer_support","agent_endpoint":"https://agentproof-opal.vercel.app/v1/chat"}'   # baseline → PASSED
uv run uipath run agent '{"suite_id":"aria_customer_support","agent_endpoint":"https://agentproof-opal.vercel.app/v2/chat"}'   # regressed → FAILED

# 4. Publish to UiPath Orchestrator
uipath auth && uipath pack && uipath publish --tenant
```

Alternatively, use the hosted application: open **[agentproof-opal.vercel.app/test](https://agentproof-opal.vercel.app/test)**, connect your UiPath tenant, select a published agent, and run a validation.

## Built with UiPath for Coding Agents

Every layer of AgentProof — the LangGraph validation engine, the published coded agents, the Orchestrator REST integration, native job execution, per-tenant authentication, and the dashboard — was developed using **Claude Code via UiPath for Coding Agents**. The demo video includes the build process.

<br/>

## The mission

Enterprises are deploying AI agents faster than they can govern them. AgentProof brings **CI/CD principles to enterprise AI** — validating behavior before deployment, detecting regressions automatically, and preventing broken agents from ever reaching production. Quality becomes a gate, not a hope.
